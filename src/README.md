## Introduction

Aujourd'hui RPG is an interactive role-playing game set in modern-day France. Players create a character and navigate through dynamic scenarios generated by AI. Choices made by the player impact the story and character statistics, offering a unique and replayable experience. The game aims for a calm and immersive experience with a clean, modern interface.

## Core Features

*   **Character Creation:** Create a player profile with a name, background, and starting stats.
*   **Interactive Scenarios:** Engage with scenarios presented in HTML format, making choices that directly influence the narrative.
*   **Dynamic Storytelling:** Experience a story that evolves with your decisions, powered by generative AI. Events are tailored to be relevant to contemporary life in France.
*   **Stat Tracking:** Monitor and see your character's stats change based on scenario outcomes and choices.
*   **Living Economy**: Actively earn money through jobs and manage realistic expenses. The world has a cost.
*   **Intelligent Transport System**: Travel between locations with choices of transport mode (walk, metro, taxi), each with time, cost, and energy trade-offs. Journeys can include narrative events.
*   **Geospatial Analysis**: Use AI-powered tools to get strategic insights on your current location, including safety, atmosphere, and hidden gems.
*   **Save and Load Progress:** Save your game state and return to it later. Progress for registered users is saved to the cloud.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** Next.js (React framework)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, Radix UI (for unstyled UI components)
*   **Backend & Database:** Firebase (Firestore, Authentication)
*   **AI & Generative Content:** Genkit (using Google AI)
*   **Language:** TypeScript

## Getting Started

This section will guide you through setting up and running Aujourd'hui RPG locally.

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js:** Make sure you have Node.js installed (version 20.x or later recommended). You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **npm:** npm (Node Package Manager) is included with Node.js.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone your-repository-url-here.git
    cd aujourdhui-rpg # Or your project's directory name
    ```
    *(Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the repository)*

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server for Next.js:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will typically start the application on `http://localhost:3000`.

The AI functionalities are powered by Genkit. To run the Genkit flows locally (e.g., for testing or development of AI features):

```bash
npm run genkit:dev
```

Or to watch for changes in AI-related files:

```bash
npm run genkit:watch
```

### Environment Variables

This project requires certain environment variables to be set up for full functionality, particularly for Firebase and AI services.

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
2.  Add the necessary environment variables. While specific variable names can vary based on updates, you will typically need:

    *   **Firebase Configuration:**
        ```
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
        # NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id (optional)
        ```
        (You can get these from your Firebase project settings.)

    *   **Google AI / Genkit Configuration:**
        ```
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key
        ```
        (This is for the generative AI features.)

**Important:** Do not commit your `.env` file to version control. Ensure it is listed in your `.gitignore` file.
